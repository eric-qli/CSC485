    """A PartialParse is a snapshot of an arc-standard dependency parse

    It is fully defined by a quadruple (sentence, stack, next, arcs).

    sentence is a tuple of ordered pairs of (word, tag), where word
    is a a word string and tag is its part-of-speech tag.

    Index 0 of sentence refers to the special "root" node
    (None, self.root_tag). Index 1 of sentence refers to the sentence's
    first word, index 2 to the second, etc.

    stack is a list of indices referring to elements of
    sentence. The 0-th index of stack should be the bottom of the stack,
    the (-1)-th index is the top of the stack (the side to pop from).

    next is the next index that can be shifted from the buffer to the
    stack. When next == len(sentence), the buffer is empty.

    arcs is a list of triples (idx_head, idx_dep, deprel) signifying the
    dependency relation `idx_head ->_deprel idx_dep`, where idx_head is
    the index of the head word, idx_dep is the index of the dependant,
    and deprel is a string representing the dependency relation label.

        the arc-transitions this object models matches the
        DependencyGraph "graph". For arcs, it also has to pick out the
        correct dependency relationship.
        graph is projective: informally, this means no crossed lines in the
        dependency graph. More formally, if i -> j and j -> k, then:
             if i > j (left-arc), i > k
             if i < j (right-arc), i < k

        You don't need to worry about API specifics about graph; just call the
        relevant helper functions from the HELPER FUNCTIONS section below. In
        particular, you will (probably) need:
         - get_dep_rel(i, graph), which will return the dependency relation
           label for the word at index i
         - get_head(i, graph), which will return the index of the head word for
           the word at index i
         - get_deps(i, graph), which will return the indices of the dependants
           of the word at index i

        Hint: take a look at get_dep_left and get_dep_right below; their
        implementations may help or give you ideas even if you don't need to
        call the functions themselves.

        *IMPORTANT* if left-arc and shift operations are both valid and
        can lead to the same graph, always choose the left-arc
        operation.

        *ALSO IMPORTANT* make sure to use the values `self.left_arc_id`,
        `self.right_arc_id`, `self.shift_id` for the transition rather than
        0, 1, and 2 directly
